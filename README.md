Foresight DAO - AI-Powered Treasury Management for Midnight Blockchain
ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) manage billions in treasury assets, yet most lack sophisticated risk management tools. Treasury mismanagement leads to:

Concentration Risk: Over-allocation in volatile governance tokens
Liquidity Crises: Insufficient stablecoin reserves for operational expenses
Manual Analysis: Time-consuming, error-prone treasury health assessments
Reactive Management: No proactive alerts for dangerous portfolio imbalances

Traditional finance has automated portfolio management and risk analysis. DAOs need the same level of intelligence, but with privacy-first, decentralized execution on blockchain infrastructure.
ðŸ’¡ Solution
Foresight DAO is an AI-powered treasury management system built on Midnight blockchain that provides:
Core Features (Implemented)

Real-time Risk Scoring Algorithm: Analyzes token concentration, stablecoin ratios, and treasury size to generate actionable risk scores (0-10 scale)
Intelligent Recommendations Engine: Custom-built AI system (not ElizaOS) that generates context-aware rebalancing strategies based on actual portfolio metrics
Privacy-First Integration: Built on Midnight.js for secure, private treasury analysis
Interactive Dashboard: Professional UI displaying TVL, token balances, risk metrics, and AI-generated insights
Conversational Treasury Assistant: Natural language interface for querying risk factors, rebalancing strategies, and token-specific analysis

Key Innovations

Custom AI Agent System: Built proprietary analysis engine rather than using ElizaOS framework, optimized specifically for DAO treasury risk assessment
Multi-Factor Risk Scoring: Combines concentration risk, stablecoin ratios, and portfolio size into unified risk metric
Context-Aware Recommendations: AI generates specific, actionable advice (e.g., "Reduce DGOV from 500 to 250 tokens") rather than generic suggestions
Privacy-Preserved Analysis: Leverages Midnight blockchain's privacy features for confidential treasury monitoring

ðŸ”§ Technology Stack

Blockchain: Midnight.js (privacy-first Web3 development)
Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
AI System: Custom-built analysis engine with template-based intelligence
Backend: Next.js API Routes
Data Integration: Midnight testnet token balances (DFUND, DGOV, tDUST)

ðŸ“Š Current Capabilities
The system analyzes three key token types:

DFUND: Stablecoin for volatility buffering
DGOV: Governance tokens for voting rights
tDUST: Native Midnight token for operations

Risk Assessment Metrics:

Total Value Locked (TVL)
Stablecoin ratio (target: 40-60%)
Concentration risk (flags >90% single-asset exposure)
Operational readiness (checks for gas token availability)
